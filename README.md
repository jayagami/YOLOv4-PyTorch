# YOLOv4
A PyTorch re-implementation of YOLOv4 architecture based on the official darknet implementation [AlexeyAB/darknet](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet)

## Disclaimer
This repository only contains YOLOv4 architecture (CSPDarknet53 + SPP + PANet) for anyone interested in to employ. It does not include training code which requires many additional training tricks, Bag of Freebies (BoF), mentioned in the paper.
